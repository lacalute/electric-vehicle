# Electric Vehicle Population Data.
How many electric vehicles are actually in the U.S. states? 
So, you can find it out using my program!

P.S Unfortunately, the script is working more or less only with Washington state. You can type another states, but script won't be work right, becaouse of not enough informations about another states in dataset. You can see it for yourself.

# The Algorithm of program
1. Choose the option of program
First option will open the diagram with the data, which you'll type
Seconds option will open the map in the web server (localhost), which will be marked with markers, which will show the vehicles positions of states in city, which you'll type
2. After choice the option, just type the necessary data into program
3. Just enjoy the visualization 
4. Thank you, Lacalute :)
